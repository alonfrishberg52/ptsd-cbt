Given the patient's description, it seems there are no specific triggers provided for אלון פרישברג. To create a suitable plan for part 1, we will develop a hypothetical scenario based on his hobbies and general symptoms. Since there are no specific triggers listed, we'll focus on a general situation that could involve mild anxiety based on his symptoms such as 'עוררות יתר' (hyperarousal) and 'צעקות' (shouting).
