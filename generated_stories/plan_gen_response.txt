Based on the provided information, Alon פרישברג has no specific triggers listed. This lack of detailed trigger information makes it challenging to create a specific exposure plan typically used in CBT for PTSD. However, we can create a hypothetical scenario involving a general anxiety-provoking situation that aligns with Alon's interests, hobbies, and symptoms. This scenario will focus on gradually introducing Alon to a situation that might trigger his symptoms like heightened arousal or nightmares, without specific trauma-related triggers.

### Plan for Part 1: Planning for the Anxiety Triggering Situation

#### Scenario Overview:
Alon is planning to attend a film screening event at a local cinema, which is aligned with his interest in cinema. Given his symptoms, such an event might evoke anxiety due to the crowded environment and potential loud noises, which could be triggering for someone with heightened arousal and a history of nightmares.

**Objective:**
To prepare Alon for attending the event by considering potential triggers and planning coping strategies.

#### Triggers and Word Allocation:

1. **Crowded Environment (SUD: 4)** 
   - **Proximity:** The crowd will be present throughout the event, but Alon will initially observe it from a distance.
   - **Word Count:** 300 words

2. **Loud Noises (SUD: 5)**
   - **Proximity:** The sounds of the film and the crowd's reactions might be jarring.
   - **Word Count:** 400 words

3. **Unfamiliar Environment (SUD: 3)**
   - **Proximity:** The cinema setting is new to Alon, adding to his anxiety.
   - **Word Count:** 200 words

4. **Social Interaction (SUD: 2)**
   - **Proximity:** Interaction with staff and other attendees might be required.
   - **Word Count:** 100 words

**Total Word Count for Part 1:** 1000 words

#### Planning Strategies:
- **Crowded Environment:** Plan to arrive early to choose a seat at the edge of the crowd, providing a sense of security and an easy exit if needed.
- **Loud Noises:** Bring noise-cancelling headphones or earplugs to minimize the impact of sudden loud sounds.
- **Unfamiliar Environment:** Research the cinema layout and event schedule beforehand to reduce uncertainty.
- **Social Interaction:** Prepare simple phrases for necessary interactions, allowing Alon to feel more in control.

This plan provides a structured approach to help Alon gradually face a situation that could potentially trigger his PTSD symptoms, while incorporating his interests to maintain engagement and motivation. The focus is on preparation and coping, without including specific trauma-related details.
